# RVB Data Sciences Corp: Building a High-Performance Agency Website with Astro

When establishing RVB Data Sciences Corp in Burlington, Ontario, we needed a website that would showcase our services while demonstrating our technical expertise. This case study examines how we built our agency website using Astro, focusing on performance optimization and developer experience.

## Project Requirements

As a technology agency offering development, hosting, and automation solutions, our website needed to:

- Load extremely quickly to demonstrate our performance-focused approach
- Showcase our services effectively
- Establish technical credibility
- Enable easy content updates
- Serve as a practical example of our development capabilities

## Tech Stack Selection

<StackComparison
  frameworks={[
    {
      name: 'Next.js',
      pros: ['Mature ecosystem', 'Strong React foundation'],
      cons: ['Heavier than needed', 'React overhead for static content'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Gatsby',
      pros: ['Great image optimization', 'Plugin ecosystem'],
      cons: ['Build times', 'Complex data layer for simple sites'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Astro',
      pros: ['Partial hydration', 'Framework-agnostic', 'Performance'],
      cons: ['Newer ecosystem', 'Fewer plugins'],
    },
  ]}
/>

After evaluating several modern frameworks, we selected Astro for its partial hydration approach ("Islands Architecture"), framework agnosticism, and performance-first philosophy.

<InfoBox type="tip">
  Astro's approach of only sending JavaScript for interactive components aligned perfectly with our mostly static site
  with targeted interactive elements.
</InfoBox>

```astro
---
// Astro component showcasing partial hydration
import ReactCounter from '~/components/widgets/ReactCounter.jsx';
import { ContentSection } from '~/components/widgets/ContentSection.jsx';
---

<!-- Static HTML rendering by default -->
<section class="hero">
  <h1>RVB Data Sciences</h1>
  <p>Transforming businesses through technology</p>
</section>

<!-- Only hydrates when needed -->
<ReactCounter client:visible />

<!-- Content remains static and zero-JS -->
<ContentSection title="Our Services">
  <p>Web development, cloud hosting, and automation solutions</p>
</ContentSection>
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Project Structure

We organized the project following a component-driven architecture:

- **Components** - Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, sections)
- **Content** - Service descriptions and case studies in Markdown
- **Pages** - Page templates and routing
- **Styles** - Global styles and utilities

### Performance Optimizations

We implemented several key optimizations:

- Image optimization with `astro:assets`
- Self-hosted fonts with `font-display: swap`
- Selective prefetching for common navigation paths
- CSS minimization with PostCSS and cssnano
- Critical CSS inlined in `<head>`

<PerformanceMetrics
  lighthouse={{
    performance: 99,
    accessibility: 100,
    bestPractices: 100,
    seo: 100,
  }}
  metrics={{
    fcp: '0.8s',
    lcp: '1.2s',
    cls: '0.02',
    ttfb: '120ms',
    tti: '1.4s',
  }}
/>

### Deployment Strategy

Our modern deployment pipeline includes:

- GitHub repository with branch protection
- Automated testing via GitHub Actions
- Edge-optimized hosting on Cloudflare Pages
- Privacy-focused analytics with Plausible

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge: Dynamic Service Filtering

We needed to allow visitors to filter services without sacrificing the static nature of the site. Our solution used client-side filtering that only hydrated when a user interacted with filters:

```astro
---
// services.astro
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import ServiceCard from '~/components/widgets/ServiceCard.astro';
import ServiceFilter from '~/components/widgets/ServiceFilter.jsx';

const allServices = await getCollection('services');
---

<section>
  <h2>Our Services</h2>

  <!-- Hydrates only when needed -->
  <ServiceFilter client:visible services={allServices} />

  <!-- Static rendering initially -->
  <div class="services-grid">
    {allServices.map((service) => <ServiceCard service={service} />)}
  </div>
</section>
```

### Challenge: Contact Form without JavaScript

We implemented a functional contact form that works without JavaScript using Cloudflare Workers, with progressive enhancement for users with JavaScript enabled.

## Results and Impact

The new website delivered measurable benefits:

- **20% increase** in contact form submissions
- **35% reduction** in bounce rate
- **15% improvement** in conversion rate
- **2x increase** in organic search traffic

## Key Takeaways

- **Performance matters** - Lighthouse scores translated directly to business metrics
- **Progressive enhancement** - Building for resilience paid dividends
- **Content strategy first** - Defining content structure before implementation saved refactoring
- **New doesn't mean risky** - Betting on Astro despite its relative newness proved advantageous

The website now serves as an effective portfolio piece, demonstrating our technical capabilities to potential clients.

## Conclusion

Building our agency website with Astro demonstrated that choosing the right technology for specific requirements yields exceptional results. By prioritizing performance, content management, and developer experience, we created a website that effectively showcases our services while serving as a testament to our technical approach.

Our performance-first mindset with progressive enhancement for interactivity has become our standard approach for web development projects, with the performance metrics convincing clients of its value.
