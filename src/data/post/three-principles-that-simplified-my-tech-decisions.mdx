# Three Principles That Simplified My Tech Decisions

Last month, a junior developer asked me how I decide which technologies to use for a new project. It made me reflect on how my approach has evolved over the years.

Early in my career, I spent countless hours comparing framework benchmarks, reading heated debates on Reddit, and feeling constant FOMO with each new library release. The pressure to use the "right" or "best" tech stack was paralyzing.

Now, after many projects (and many mistakes), I've developed three principles that have dramatically simplified my decision-making process.

## 1. Optimize for Clarity, Not Cleverness

In a client project last year, I had the choice between:

- A cutting-edge approach using the latest meta-framework with partial hydration
- A slightly "boring" approach using tools the team already knew well

I chose the latter, despite the allure of the new tech. Six months later, when we needed to onboard two new developers and push out urgent fixes, that decision paid off immensely. The learning curve was minimal, and productivity remained high.

The lesson? **Code that's easy to understand is more valuable than code that's technically impressive.**

This doesn't mean avoiding innovation—it means ensuring the complexity serves a purpose beyond intellectual satisfaction.

## 2. Choose Tools That Match Your Project Lifespan

A common mistake I made early on was choosing technologies as if every project would exist forever. The reality is that different projects have different lifespans:

- Proof-of-concept demos (days/weeks)
- Marketing campaigns (months)
- Core business applications (years)

For a recent short-term marketing site, I skipped setting up TypeScript and a complex testing suite—decisions I'd never make for a long-term application. The site launched faster, served its purpose perfectly, and was replaced after the campaign ended.

Now I ask: **What is this project's expected lifespan, and what technical debt is acceptable given that timeframe?**

## 3. Start Simple, Add Complexity When It Hurts

My most successful projects share one trait: they started simple and added complexity only when needed.

For my portfolio site, I began with:
- Static HTML and CSS
- Basic JavaScript for interactions
- Simple form handling

As needs evolved, I added:
- A static site generator for blog content
- Light analytics for visitor insights
- Basic image optimization

What I didn't add (yet):
- A full CMS
- Complex build pipelines
- Heavy client-side frameworks

Each addition solved a specific pain point that had emerged, rather than anticipating problems that might never materialize.

The principle: **Let real problems drive technical evolution, not hypothetical ones.**

## The Freedom of Constraints

The most unexpected outcome of following these principles has been increased creativity. By reducing the universe of options and overthinking, I have more mental energy for solving the actual problems at hand.

I'm curious: Do you have your own decision-making principles for technology choices? Has overthinking tech decisions ever slowed down your progress? I'd love to hear your experiences.
